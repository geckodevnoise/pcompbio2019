Problem was: Several clouds in phenotype space weren't centered on the gecko phenotypes.

I used the same optimal mu, but used a different way to compute the threshold. 
(comment from recalculate_thresholds:

%% improvement of distance_characteristics_space: instead of optimizing the distance at every run, taking average of thresholds,
%% we find teh threshold that leads to a cloud whose c.o.m. is closest to the point in phenotype space)

)

works much better!
